__Forced alignment for speech research__  

This workshop will be an introduction to forced alignment, an automated procedure for phonetic segmentation of speech, which uses orthographic transcription as input. Forced alignment substantially speeds up the processing of sound files for analysis, and in some cases, it can be used to fully automate aspects of phonetic analysis. In the workshop, I will introduce several web-based forced alignment services, and provide hands-on training on how to use them. This approach does not require advanced computer skills. The workshop is intended for researchers who have no experience with forced alignment and who would like to use it for acoustic analysis. It will be introductory and therefore accessible for undergraduate students.
